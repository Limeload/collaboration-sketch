# Collab-Sketch

Collab-Sketch a real-time collaborative whiteboard application using Vue.js, Node.js, Redis, and WebSockets. Users can draw, add text, and insert images on a shared canvas in real-time. This project demonstrates proficiency in real-time collaboration and WebSockets.

## Features

- Real-time drawing on a collaborative canvas.
- Text insertion with synchronization between users.
- Image insertion through URL with synchronized updates.
- WebSocket-based communication for seamless real-time collaboration.
- Redis integration for handling data synchronization between users.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided Vue.js development server URL (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
2. Collaborate with other users by drawing, adding text, and inserting images in real time on the whiteboard canvas.
3. Changes made by one user will be instantly reflected on the canvas of other connected users.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: Frontend JavaScript framework.
- Node.js: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
- WebSocket: Real-time communication protocol.
- Redis: In-memory data store for data synchronization.
- HTML5 Canvas API: Drawing functionality on the frontend.
